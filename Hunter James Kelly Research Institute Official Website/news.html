  <h3>UB Chosen to Co-Lead Major State Effort to Spur Genome Research</h3>
  <div class="news_info"> January 9, 2014 |</div>
  <div class="image_wrapper fr_img"><img src="images/wrabetz_on_news.jpg" alt="Myelination Researcher Honored as Distinguished Postdoc Mentor " width="277" height="184" /></div>
  <p>Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has announced that the University at Buffalo will co-lead a statewide effort to position New York State as a national leader in genomic medicine.</p>
  <p>At his State of the State address, Cuomo said UB will partner with the New York Genome Center (NYGC) in Manhattan to accelerate recent advances in genomic medicine directly into clinical care.</p>
  <p>As part of this effort, UB will receive $50 million to increase research capacities.</p>
  <p>UB will provide NYGC - a consortium of 16 educational and research organizations - with expertise and supercomputing power.</p>
  <p><a href="http://medicine.buffalo.edu/news_and_events/news.host.html/content/shared/smbs/news/2014/01/ub-nycg-genome-research-cuomo-50-million-3560.html" target="_blank">Continue reading...</a> |</p>

<div class="image_wrapper fr_img"><img src="images/Myelination  Researcher Honored.jpg" alt="Myelination Researcher Honored as Distinguished Postdoc Mentor " width="277" height="164" /></div>
<p>M. Laura Feltri, MD, professor of biochemistry, has been honored with the 2013 Distinguished Postdoc Mentor Award. "I learned that the best strategy for me is to have a personalized approach. I give close to complete freedom to the best post-docs; others need more nurturing, especially at the beginning." </p>
<p> Sponsored by the University at Buffalo's Graduate School Office of Postdoctoral Scholars, the award was presented June 13 during the Postdoctoral Research Symposium. </p>
<p> "I am extremely honored by the award." says Feltri. "I feel it has true meaning because the nomination comes directly from my fellow co-workers."</p>

<h3>Researchers ID Neuropathy Cause, Restore Myelination </h3>
<div class="news_info">May 22, 2013 |</div>  

<div class="image_wrapper fr_img"><img src="images/Experiments by Lawrence Wrabetz.jpg" alt="Researchers ID Neuropathy Cause, Restore Myelination " width="277" height="164" /></div>
<p>Neuroscientists at the University at Buffalo's Hunter James Kelly Research Institute (HJKRI) and European colleagues have provided proof of principle for how a genetic mutation leads to some neuropathies.</p>
<p>The international team also used a research drug to successfully alleviate the protein synthesis misstep, thereby improving myelin. Myelin is the fatty material that wraps the axons of neurons and allows them to signal effectively.</p>
<p>As a result, a potential new treatment strategy may be on the horizon for patients with a host of neurological disorders that result from misfolded proteins.</p>

<h3>New Research Suggests Treatment for Neurological Disorders such as CMT, Alzheimer's </h3>
<div class="news_info">April 29, 2013 |</div>  

<div class="image_wrapper fr_img"><img src="images/treatment news.jpg" alt="new treatment for patints with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease" width="278" height="146" /></div>
<p>A potential new treatment strategy for patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is on the horizon, thanks to research by neuroscientists now at the University at Buffalo's Hunter James Kelly Research Institute and their colleagues in Italy and England.</p>
<p>The institute is the research arm of the Hunter's Hope Foundation, established in 1997 by Jim Kelly, Buffalo Bills Hall of Fame quarterback, and his wife, Jill, after their infant son Hunter was diagnosed with Krabbe Leukodystrophy, an inherited fatal disorder of the nervous system. Hunter died in 2005 at the age of eight. The institute conducts research on myelin and its related diseases with the goal of developing new ways of understanding and treating conditions such as Krabbe disease and other leukodystrophies.</p>

<h3>CURCA Funds Student's Biochemistry Research </h3>
<div class="news_info">February 28, 2013 |</div>  

<div class="image_wrapper fr_img"><img src="images/Nunes_Gustavo.jpg" alt="Image 05" /></div>
<p>An exchange student investigating the metabolic exchange that occurs between myelin and axons has received an award from the <a href=			  										"http://curca.buffalo.edu/">Center for Undergraduate Research and Creative Activities (CURCA)</a>.</p>
<p>Gustavo Della Flora Nunes, a scholar with Brazil's Science Without Borders program, conducts research with <a href=		"http://medicine.buffalo.edu/content/medicine/faculty/profile.html?ubit=mlfeltri">M. Laura Feltri, MD</a>, professor of <a href="http://medicine.buffalo.edu/biochemistry.html"> biochemistry</a> and <a href="http://ubnjacobsneuro.wordpress.com/home/">neurology</a>.</p>
<p>Shedding Light on Axonal Damage
Nunes' research could help scientists design protection for axons in demyelinating disorders like multiple sclerosis.

He is studying what happens to axons when the metabolism of its surrounding glial cells is damaged. His research involves eliminating a crucial energy-producing component in myelinating glia.
Myelin, made by glial cells, is the fatty sheath surrounding an axon, the part of a neuron that transmits impulses away from the cell body. Scientists believe that myelin cells provide nutrients and energy to neurons.</p>

<h3>Arrival of Wrabetz and Feltri moves work of Kelly institute forward</h3>

<div class="news_info">November 3, 2011 |</div>
<div class="image_wrapper fr_img"><img src="images/Wrabetz_Feltri.jpg" alt="Image 05" /></div>
<p>The mission of the Hunter James Kelly Research Institute (HJKRI) is moving forward with great fervor with the recent arrival of highly regarded neuroscientists Lawrence Wrabetz and Laura Feltri.</p>
<p>Dubbed "physiccian-scientist superstars" by Michael Cain, dean of the School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, at the press conference in 2010 announcing the pair's recruitment to UB, Wrabetz is the institute's first director and holds a primary appointment in the Department of Neurology, with a secondary appointment in the Department of Biochemistry; Feltri has a primary appointment in Biochemistry.</p>
<p>The husband-wife research team arrived in Buffalo in late spring from Milan, Italy, with family and laboratories, including 10 research associates-eight of Italian and two of French descents-and 56 lines of transgenic mice.</p>

<h3>Noted Researchers Join Kelly Institute</h3>

<div class="news_info">August 12, 2010 |</div>
<div class="image_wrapper fr_img"><img src="images/spotlight.jpg" alt="spotlight" /></div>
<p>Lawrence Wrabetz, head of the myelin biology unit at San Raffaele Scientific Institute in Milan, Italy, has been appointed director of the Hunter James Kelly Research Institute (HJKRI) at UB.</p>
<p>Laura Feltri, who heads the neuroglia unit at the Italian institute and is Wrabetz's spouse, also has been recruited to the HJKRI, which was established in 2004 by UB and the Hunter's Hope Foundation. Wrabetz and Feltri will begin transitioning their laboratories to Buffalo this fall.</p>
<p>Both are highly regarded neuroscientists with significant backgrounds in basic and translational research on myelin, known as white matter-the sheath protecting brain nerve fibers that is essential for all normal functioning of the nervous system. They will work as a team in the HJKRI, located in UB's New York State Center of Excellence in Bioinformatics and Life Sciences on the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus in downtown Buffalo.</p>
